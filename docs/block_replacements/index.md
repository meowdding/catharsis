# Block replacements

In Catharsis we allow retexturing and remodelling of blocks.
This allows you to change the look of the same block in different regions of the game.

You can define block replacements in a block replacement definition file in `assets/<block namespace>/catharsis/block_replacements/<id>.json`

You can find more details on how to use these block replacements on the sidebar.
